My toolkit revolves around the **Laravel and Vue JS** ecosystem. I enjoy crafting everything from robust APIs and full-stack applications to open-source tools like the [Mary UI Laravel Starter Kit](https://github.com/lauroguedes/mary-ui-starter-kit) and [Bloomfolio](https://github.com/lauroguedes/bloomfolio), an Astro portfolio template that's been forked dozens of times.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring AI art, traveling, or listening to 🎸 heavy music way too loud.
